liblog provides a simple to use, internationalized, threaded,
high-performance, C logging API licensed under the `MIT license
<LICENSE.txt>`_.

Log messages may be simply constructed, optionally enqueued and read
by a different thread, and logged to console/file or to syslog. New
logging backends may be simply added.

Log messages may be simply and easily internationalized with language
choice being possible at runtime.

It is designed to minimize the CPU cost of logging in the current
thread to optimize performance.

Currently supported platforms include Linux and OSX.

See the `Developers Guide <doc/DeveloperGuide.rst>`_ for information
on how compile and use liblog and for further information on features.
