Installation Guide
==================

Binary packages
---------------
Binary packages for a limited number of platforms (typically latest
Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, OSX) are available from `cobaro.org
<https://www.cobaro.org/liblog>`_.

For RedHat and Debian based systems the runtime package contains only
the shared libraries and need only be installed if shared library
linkage is desired. The developer package contains everything needed
to build statically-linked applications.

Building from source
--------------------
Source releases can be obtained from `github
<https://github.com/cobaro/liblog>`_.

To initialize your build environment following an initial clone, or
to reset it for some other reason, you should run the ``bootstrap``
script.

To configure your build for the host OS platform, set compiler
options, and choose optional build features, you should run the
``configure`` script (generated by ``bootstrap``).  ``configure
--help`` describes its many options.

To compile and link the main library, you should run ``make`` (after
having run ``bootstrap`` and ``configure``).  You do not need to
re-bootstrap and re-configure for each build.

To install, run ``make install``, and to remove the installed files,
``make uninstall``.  These will target ``/usr/local`` by default, but
you can override this with the ``--prefix`` option to ``configure``.

To run the unit tests, run ``make check``.

To build an RPM or DEB package, run ``make package`` on the target
platform.
