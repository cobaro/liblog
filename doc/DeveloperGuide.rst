Developer's Guide
=========================

Quickstart
----------

liblog provides a simple threaded C logging API licensed under the MIT
license.

Log messages may be simply constructed, optionally enqueued
and read by a different thread, and logged to console/file or to
syslog. New logging backends could be simply added.

It is designed to minimize the CPU cost of logging in the current
thread to optimize performance.

Currently supported platforms include Linux and OSX.

Code level documentation is provided via doxygen.

Binary packages
---------------
Binary packages for a limited number of platforms (typically latest
ubuntu, redhat, OSC) are available from `cobaro.org
https://www.cobaro.org//liblog`_.

For redhat and debian based systems the runtime package contains only
the shared libraries and need only be installed if shared library
linkage is desired. The developer package contains everything needed
to provide statically linked libraries.

Building from source
--------------------
Source releases can be obtained from `github
https://github.com/cobaro/liblog`_.

To initialize your build environment following an initial checkout, or
to reset it for some other reason, you should run the ``bootstrap``
script.

To configure your build for the host OS platform, set compiler
options, and choose optional build features, you should run the
``configure`` script (generated by ``bootstrap``).  ``configure
--help`` describes its many options.

To compile and link the main executable, your should run ``make`` (after
having run ``bootstrap`` and ``configure``).  You do not need to
re-bootstrap and re-configure for each build.

To run the unit tests, run ``make check``.

To build an RPM or DEB package, run ``make package``.

Build environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Compiler assumed to be GCC 4.7+

* CFLAGS assumed to contain -std=gnu99.

* `Greatest <https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest>`_ is used for testing
